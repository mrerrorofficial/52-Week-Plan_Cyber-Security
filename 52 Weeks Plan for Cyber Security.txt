Week 31-32: Exploit Development

Learn how to write exploits (buffer overflow, format string attacks).
Study concepts from books like "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson.
Week 33-34: Cloud Security

Study cloud security fundamentals (AWS, Azure, GCP).
Learn about IAM, cloud-specific threats, and configurations.
Hands-on: Use cloud environments to implement security measures.
Week 35-36: SIEM and SOC Operations

Learn about SIEM tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, or QRadar.
Simulate monitoring and incident response in a SOC environment.
Phase 4: Specialization & Certification Prep (Weeks 37–52)
Goal: Gain expertise and certifications.

Week 37-40: Specialization Focus
Choose a specialization:

Penetration Testing
Dive deeper into exploit development and advanced hacking techniques.
